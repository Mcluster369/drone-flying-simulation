## 📌 Overview
Drone Flying Simulation is an interactive web application that allows users to simulate flying a drone by entering mission details such as location, weather, altitude, payload, and battery levels.  
The app uses JavaScript to calculate responses in real time, providing both a quick simulation and a live telemetry-based simulation.

---

## ✨ Features
- Enter mission details (location, weather, altitude, payload, battery).  
- **Quick Simulation**: instant calculation of flight time, range, and risk level.  
- **Live Simulation**: step-by-step telemetry updates with dynamic visualization.  
- Object-oriented JavaScript design with reusable functions.  
- Fully responsive, runs in any modern browser.
